## Notes
- Starting with the program, I copy down the function that you had already made in the video
- Then I notice the output element so I figured there must be a div for it to display in the index.html so I added that
- I then create most of the structure based on the video instruction and the codes we already have on pri repo.
- It manage to rectrieve the photos but did not render properly so I don't really know how to fix that, I'll submit and wait for feedback then watch the solutions video.
