# To do list for improvement
These ideas are what I think that is achivable and realistic enough for me to implement with my current skillset. Although more trials and errors are definitely needed to make sure that it's possible. 

## 1. Add Detailed Routine Descriptions
    - Purpose: Provide additional tips or product examples for each step in the routine to educate users.
    - Implementation: Create a collapsible section in the table row for each routine that reveals detailed descriptions or product suggestions when expanded.

## 2. Add Routine Sharing Feature
    - Purpose: Help users to share their customized skincare routines through a link or social media.
    - Implemendation: Since the purpose of the app is to help user find their skincare routine, the app can generate a unique link for user to share/copy their routines. 

## 3. Add Shopping Links for Products
    - Purpose: Help users find and purchase products directly from storefront sites.
    - Implementation: Maybe refer and redirect the user's to a website that they can purchase products from, with the site I'm most frequent and use by is "https://www.yesstyle.com/en/home.html"
