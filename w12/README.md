# Week 12 Process
- I started out by making a basic index.html webpage, similary to the one we made in the carboon footprint program. 
- For the form, I used 4 different types of excerises, pullups, curls, squats and jogging.
- I forgot to add the style.css so I added those too and starting to slowly style the page
- I then use this website for the color pallete: "https://coolors.co/ffaf87-ff8e72-ed6a5e-4ce0b3-377771"
- After finishing all the initial setup and setting the id types values, I then move to the main.js
- I then create the functions, one to call out the input and an event listener button
- I finish all the const for a basic event listeners, based on previous week's codes.
- I'm now attempting to do the setTimeout, using the exampled provided code in the website you gave us. 
- The setTimeOut works and the display works as well, with no error so far so I'll keep what I have right now and commit.
